Core Code Snippets for Protein Structure Prediction (Conceptual)
Here are foundational examples for the key technical areas:

1. Protein Sequence Representation: One-Hot Encoding and Simple Embedding
This snippet shows how to convert an amino acid sequence into numerical formats suitable for deep learning models.

Python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import numpy as np

# Define all 20 standard amino acids (case-insensitive for robustness)
AMINO_ACIDS = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
AA_TO_INT = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(AMINO_ACIDS)}
INT_TO_AA = {i: aa for aa, i in AA_TO_INT.items()}

def sequence_to_one_hot(sequence, max_len=None):
    """
    Converts an amino acid sequence to a one-hot encoded representation.
    
    Args:
        sequence (str): The amino acid sequence (e.g., "MDR").
        max_len (int, optional): Maximum length for padding/truncation.
                                 If None, uses actual sequence length.
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: One-hot encoded tensor of shape (max_len, 20).
    """
    seq_len = len(sequence)
    if max_len is None:
        actual_len = seq_len
    else:
        actual_len = min(seq_len, max_len)

    one_hot_tensor = torch.zeros(actual_len, len(AMINO_ACIDS))
    for i in range(actual_len):
        aa = sequence[i].upper()
        if aa in AA_TO_INT:
            one_hot_tensor[i, AA_TO_INT[aa]] = 1
        # Amino acids not in AMINO_ACIDS (e.g., 'X' for unknown) will remain all zeros
    
    # Pad if max_len is specified and sequence is shorter
    if max_len is not None and seq_len < max_len:
        padding = torch.zeros(max_len - seq_len, len(AMINO_ACIDS))
        one_hot_tensor = torch.cat((one_hot_tensor, padding), dim=0)

    return one_hot_tensor

def sequence_to_indices(sequence, max_len=None):
    """
    Converts an amino acid sequence to a list of integer indices.
    
    Args:
        sequence (str): The amino acid sequence.
        max_len (int, optional): Maximum length for padding/truncation.
    Returns:
        torch.Tensor: Tensor of integer indices.
    """
    indices = [AA_TO_INT.get(aa.upper(), len(AMINO_ACIDS)) for aa in sequence] # Use 20 for unknown/padding
    
    if max_len is not None:
        if len(indices) > max_len:
            indices = indices[:max_len]
        elif len(indices) < max_len:
            indices.extend([len(AMINO_ACIDS)] * (max_len - len(indices))) # Pad with index for 'unknown'

    return torch.tensor(indices, dtype=torch.long)

# --- Example Usage ---
sample_sequence = "MDRCK"
max_sequence_length = 10 # Example max length for batching

print(f"Original sequence: {sample_sequence}")

# 1. One-hot encoding
one_hot_representation = sequence_to_one_hot(sample_sequence, max_len=max_sequence_length)

# 2. Integer indices for embedding layer
indexed_sequence = sequence_to_indices(sample_sequence, max_len=max_sequence_length)
print(f"\nIndexed sequence for embedding (shape {indexed_sequence.shape}):\n{indexed_sequence}")

# 3. PyTorch Embedding Layer
# Create an embedding layer: vocab_size=21 (20 AAs + 1 for padding/unknown), embedding_dim=32
embedding_dim = 32
embedding_layer = nn.Embedding(num_embeddings=len(AMINO_ACIDS) + 1, embedding_dim=embedding_dim, padding_idx=len(AMINO_ACIDS))

# Apply embedding to the indexed sequence
embedded_sequence = embedding_layer(indexed_sequence)
print(f"\nEmbedded sequence (shape {embedded_sequence.shape}):\n{embedded_sequence}")

# You would typically pass these embeddings to subsequent layers like LSTMs, CNNs, or Transformers.
2. Conceptual Graph Representation (as a prelude to GNNs)
Representing a protein as a graph is crucial for GNNs. This is a conceptual illustration of how nodes (amino acids) and edges (interactions) could be set up. A full GNN implementation would use libraries like PyTorch Geometric or DGL.

Python

# Conceptual representation of a protein as a graph
# In a real scenario, 'edges' would represent various types of interactions
# (e.g., covalent bonds, residue-residue contacts based on distance in 3D).

class ProteinGraph:
    def __init__(self, sequence):
        self.sequence = sequence.upper()
        self.num_residues = len(self.sequence)
        self.nodes = [(i, aa) for i, aa in enumerate(self.sequence)] # (index, amino_acid)
        self.edges = [] # List of (node1_idx, node2_idx, edge_type)

    def add_peptide_bonds(self):
        """Adds bonds between consecutive amino acids (backbone)."""
        for i in range(self.num_residues - 1):
            self.edges.append((i, i + 1, 'peptide_bond'))

    def add_conceptual_contacts(self, cutoff_distance_angstroms=8.0):
        """
        Adds conceptual non-covalent contacts.
        In a real scenario, this would be based on predicted 3D distances.
        Here, it's just a placeholder for potential interactions.
        """
        print(f"Adding conceptual contacts (e.g., from predicted distance map)...")
        # For demonstration, let's assume some arbitrary contacts
        # In reality, this comes from complex prediction.
        if self.num_residues > 5:
            self.edges.append((0, 4, 'distant_contact')) # Example: 1st and 5th residue might be close
            self.edges.append((1, 5, 'distant_contact'))
            # ... more complex logic to identify contacts
        print("  (Note: Actual contacts derived from predicted 3D coordinates or evolutionary coupling)")

    def display_conceptual_graph(self):
        print(f"\n--- Conceptual Protein Graph for '{self.sequence}' ---")
        print(f"Nodes (Residues): {self.nodes}")
        print(f"Edges (Interactions): {self.edges}")
        print("-------------------------------------------------")

# --- Example Usage ---
sample_protein_sequence = "MDRCKYTRQ"
protein_graph = ProteinGraph(sample_protein_sequence)
protein_graph.add_peptide_bonds()
protein_graph.add_conceptual_contacts() # This would be where your DL model's output influences edges
protein_graph.display_conceptual_graph()

# For actual GNNs, you would use PyTorch Geometric or DGL's graph data structures
# and build message-passing layers to learn from these graphs.
3. Simplified Self-Attention Layer (PyTorch)
This custom nn.Module demonstrates the core idea of a self-attention mechanism, which is fundamental to Transformers and Evoformer-like architectures. This allows the model to weigh the importance of different amino acids when processing a sequence.

Python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class SimpleSelfAttention(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_dim):
        """
        A very simplified self-attention mechanism.
        This does not include multi-head attention, positional encoding,
        or complex feed-forward networks found in full Transformers.
        
        Args:
            embed_dim (int): The dimensionality of the input feature vectors (embeddings).
        """
        super().__init__()
        self.embed_dim = embed_dim
        
        # Linear transformations for Query, Key, Value
        self.query_transform = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.key_transform = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        self.value_transform = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        """
        Args:
            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor, typically sequence embeddings.
                              Shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, embed_dim)
        Returns:
            torch.Tensor: Output tensor with attention applied.
                          Shape: (batch_size, sequence_length, embed_dim)
        """
        # Apply linear transformations
        queries = self.query_transform(x) # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        keys = self.key_transform(x)    # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        values = self.value_transform(x) # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        
        # Calculate attention scores: Query dot Key (scaled)
        # (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim) @ (batch_size, embed_dim, seq_len)
        # = (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len)

        attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1) # Sums to 1 along the last dim
        
        # Apply attention weights to Values
        # (batch_size, seq_len, seq_len) @ (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        # = (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)
        attended_output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, values)
        
        return attended_output

# --- Example Usage ---
# Assume batch_size=1, sequence_length=10, embed_dim=32
batch_size = 1
sequence_length = 10
embedding_dimension = 32

# Create a dummy input tensor (e.g., from an embedding layer)
dummy_input_embeddings = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, embedding_dimension)

# Instantiate the attention layer
attention_layer = SimpleSelfAttention(embedding_dimension)

# Pass the dummy embeddings through the attention layer
output_with_attention = attention_layer(dummy_input_embeddings)

print(f"Dummy input embeddings shape: {dummy_input_embeddings.shape}")
print(f"Output after simple self-attention shape: {output_with_attention.shape}")
print("\n(Note: A full Transformer block would include multi-head attention,")
print("  add & norm, and feed-forward networks, typically stacked.)")
4. Dummy "Prediction" Model Architecture (PyTorch)
This is a very simplified PyTorch model. It demonstrates how you might combine embeddings and attention, but its "prediction" is a placeholder for actual 3D coordinate or distance map output, which is highly complex in a real protein structure predictor.

Python

import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

# Re-using the AMINO_ACIDS and AA_TO_INT from Section 1
AMINO_ACIDS = 'ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY'
AA_TO_INT = {aa: i for i, aa in enumerate(AMINO_ACIDS)}

# Re-using SimpleSelfAttention from Section 3

    def __init__(self, embed_dim):
        super().__init__()

        keys = self.key_transform(x)
        values = self.value_transform(x)
        attention_scores = torch.matmul(queries, keys.transpose(-2, -1)) / (self.embed_dim ** 0.5)
        attention_weights = F.softmax(attention_scores, dim=-1)
        attended_output = torch.matmul(attention_weights, values)
        return attended_output

5. 3D Visualization with NGLView (in Jupyter/Colab)
This snippet demonstrates how to interactively visualize a protein's 3D structure using nglview within a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment. You'll typically load a .pdb (Protein Data Bank) file, which contains experimentally determined or previously predicted protein structures.

To run this, you need to be in a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab environment.

Python

# To install in Colab or Jupyter:
# !pip install nglview biopython ipywidgets # ipywidgets is often needed for NGLView interactivity

from Bio.PDB import PDBList # To download example PDB files

# --- Example Usage (Run this cell in Jupyter/Colab) ---
# You can try famous PDBs like '1CRN' (crambin, small protein) or '1TUP' (a larger one)
# or even AlphaFold's generated structures (though their specific PDB IDs might vary or be in AlphaFold DB)
# For AlphaFold, you might download from AlphaFold DB directly or use a PDB ID of an experimentally verified structure.
# Example AlphaFold PDB ID: "AF-O15305-F1-model_v4.pdb" from AlphaFold DB, but you'd need to download it first.
# Let's use a standard PDB ID for demonstration.

# view_widget = visualize_protein_structure(pdb_id='1CRN') # A small, well-known protein
# If running, this will display the interactive viewer.
# You can also use a protein that might be more relevant to your interests.
# For example, a common PDB ID for a human protein: '4HHB' (Hemoglobin)
